Finds longest directed cycle per (claim,status) group in routing data.
Two-pass: partition lines by CRC32 hash into buckets to bound memory.
Buckets processed in parallel (threads if GIL-free, else processes), building adjacency sets.
O(n) cycle detection when outdegree<=1; else DFS from lexicographically smallest node.
Output: claim_id,status,length
